# Software Project Management - Final Project Frontend

This project is a frontend application built using React for my final project in the Software Project Management subject. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation and Local Development


First, you will need to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PuvaanRaaj/SoftwareProjectManagement-FrontEnd.git
```
Next, navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd SoftwareProjectManagement-FrontEnd
```
Then, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Once the installation is complete, you can run the application in development mode with:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will run on http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

## Available Scripts

In addition to npm start, the following scripts are available:

### npm test

This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see the running tests section.

### npm run build

This builds the application for production to the build folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for efficient caching.\
For more information, see the deployment section.

### npm run eject

This command removes the single build dependency from the project, and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) directly into the project. This gives you full control over the build configuration, but also means that you are responsible for maintaining this configuration.
